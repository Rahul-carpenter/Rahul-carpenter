👋 About Me

I’m a hands-on learner who enjoys building and breaking systems to understand how they work in real life.
My interest lies in DevOps, backend development, and cloud technologies, where I focus on automation, deployment, and scalability.

I believe in learning by doing — that’s why most of my time goes into building practical projects instead of just following tutorials.

🔭 Currently working on EduCall Manager – a real-world student lead management system

🌱 Learning Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and AWS CI/CD workflows

🤝 Open to collaboration on DevOps, backend, or Python automation projects

💬 Ask me about Flask, Docker, Streamlit, Linux, or Shell scripting
